# Issue Reporting
* The issue list of this repo is exclusively for bug reports and feature requests. Non-conforming issues will be closed immediately.
  * For questions please join our Slack organization and go to the channel dedicated to this library.
* Try to search for your issue, it may have already been answered or even fixed in the development branch.
* It is required that you clearly describe the steps necessary to reproduce the issue you are running into. Issues with no clear repro steps will not be triaged.
* If your issue is resolved but still open, donâ€™t hesitate to close it. In case you found a solution by yourself, it could be helpful to explain how you fixed it.

# Pull Request
* The master branch is basically just a snapshot of the latest stable release. All development should be done in dedicated branches. Do not submit PRs against the master branch.
  * We use the branching model [GitFlow](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html), feel free to create dedicated branchs for your work such as `feature/new-feature`, `hotfix/bug`.
* It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - we will let GitHub automatically squash it before merging.
* Make sure `npm test` passes. (see development setup)
* If adding new feature:
  * Add accompanying test case.
  * Provide convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally you should open a suggestion issue first and have it greenlighted before working on it.

  * Add appropriate test coverage if applicable.
